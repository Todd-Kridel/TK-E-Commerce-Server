<h1>TK "E-Commerce Server" Application</h1>

<h2>* Demonstration Videos *</h2>

<p>IMPORTANT:<br/>
<br/>
For better video resolution...be sure to maximize the video display frame and maybe also the containing web 
browser tab. Also...the current display resolution of the video display frame can be increased by clicking the cog 
(Settings) button. Otherwise...For possible better resolution and play speed/smoothness...you can download the 
video either from the maximized video display frame (diagonal up-right arrow)...or by clicking the 
".webm" video file names of the GitHub repository window (which is accessed from the README file 
link at below) and then clicking the "Download" button that is located at the right side of the information line 
that indicates the MB size of the desired video file[s]. NOTE: THE DEMO VIDEOS ARE AUTOMATICALLY DOWNLOADED IF THE 
REPOSITORY IS CLONED; AND THEN YOU CAN PLAY THE VIDEOS FROM THE LOCAL CLONE DIRECTORY.</p>
